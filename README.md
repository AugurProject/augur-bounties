## <a id="bounty-two"/> Bounty #2: Portable Solidity Debugger

**2000 REP** bounty for a Solidity debugger which is portable / provided as a library.  

The debugger should have the following features:

- Set breakpoints in Solidity
- Inspect variables when those breakpoints are hit
- Execute Solidity from the context of a bremakpoint and see the result/failure
- Library that can be integrated into editors/IDEs
- VSCode integration
- Should work on any OS
- Should work with TestRPC

*Desired workflow:* set breakpoint in Solidity code, run tests (e.g., using Mocha or Pyethereum tester), drop into debugging environment.  See local variables, step forwards and backwards, see storage, etc.
